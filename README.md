# My Corona

Just four Jupyter Notebooks I've used to analyse COVID-19 data provided by [JHU
CSSE](https://systems.jhu.edu/)

You need a Python evironment with Pandas and Matplotlib installed. Start with `COVID-19 Confirmed Time
Series.ipynb`

Feel free to use. But keep in mind I've mainly used this to learn Pandas and
Matplotlib
